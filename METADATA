description: "A library for finding occurrences of many patterns at once with SIMD acceleration in some cases. This library provides multiple pattern search principally through an implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm, which builds a finite state machine for executing searches in linear time. Features include case insensitive matching, overlapping matches and search & replace in streams."
